    **Women‚Äôs Clothing E-Commerce dataset**
    
    This is a Women‚Äôs Clothing E-Commerce dataset revolving around the reviews written by customers. Its
    nine supportive features offer a great environment to parse out the text through its multiple dimensions.
    Because this is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the company in the
    review text and body have been replaced with ‚Äúretailer‚Äù.
    
    **Content:**
    
    This dataset includes 23486 rows and 10 feature variables. Each row corresponds to a customer review,
    and includes the variables:
    - Age: Positive Integer variable of the reviewers' age.
    - Title: String variable for the title of the review.
    - Review Text: String variable for the review body.
    - Rating: Positive Ordinal Integer variable for the product score granted by the customer from 1
      Worst to 5 Best.
